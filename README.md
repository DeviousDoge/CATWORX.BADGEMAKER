# CATWORX.BADGEMAKER
This is my first CSharpe app. Automatically make a series of random employee cards or make your own via the terminal. 

## Installation

Make sure you have the core .NET framework installed on your device, then clone this repo. 


## Usage

Open your terminal, %cd CATWORX.BADGEMAKER and %dotnet run. Enter your name if you want then enter "y" if you want to randomly generate 10 cards, or "n" if you want to make your own.
